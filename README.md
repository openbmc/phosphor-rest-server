# phosphor-rest-server

Phosphor REST server was the original OpenBMC webserver.  All of it's features
have long since been implemented in
[bmcweb](https://github.com/openbmc/bmcweb), and if you are looking for a
webserver for your BMC, you should certainly use that before using this.
Phosphor REST server is not maintained and very likely has security bugs.
